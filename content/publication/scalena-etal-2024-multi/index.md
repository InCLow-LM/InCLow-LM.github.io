abstract: Activation steering methods were shown to be effective in conditioning language
  model generation by additively intervening over models' intermediate representations.
  However, the evaluation of these techniques has so far been limited to single conditioning
  properties and synthetic settings. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation
  of various activation steering strategies, highlighting the property-dependent nature
  of optimal parameters to ensure a robust effect throughout generation. To address
  this issue, we propose Dynamic Activation Composition, an information-theoretic
  approach to modulate the steering intensity of one or more properties throughout
  generation. Our experiments on multi-property steering show that our method successfully
  maintains high conditioning while minimizing the impact of conditioning on generation
  fluency.
