abstract: Inseq is a recent toolkit providing an intuitive and optimized interface
  to conduct feature attribution analyses of generative language models. In this work,
  we present the latest improvements to the library, including efforts to simplify
  the attribution of large language models on consumer hardware, additional attribution
  approaches, and a new client command to detect and attribute context usage in language
  model generations. We showcase an online demo using Inseq as an attribution backbone
  for context reliance analysis, and we highlight interesting contextual patterns
  in language model generations. Ultimately, this release furthers Inseqâ€™s mission
  of centralizing good interpretability practices and enabling fair and reproducible
  model evaluations.
