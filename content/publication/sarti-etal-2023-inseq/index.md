abstract: Past work in natural language processing interpretability focused mainly
  on popular classification tasks while largely overlooking generation settings, partly
  due to a lack of dedicated tools. In this work, we introduce Inseq, a Python library
  to democratize access to interpretability analyses of sequence generation models.
  Inseq enables intuitive and optimized extraction of models' internal information
  and feature importance scores for popular decoder-only and encoder-decoder Transformers
  architectures. We showcase its potential by adopting it to highlight gender biases
  in machine translation models and locate factual knowledge inside GPT-2. Thanks
  to its extensible interface supporting cutting-edge techniques such as contrastive
  feature attribution, Inseq can drive future advances in explainable natural language
  generation, centralizing good practices and enabling fair and reproducible model
  evaluations.
