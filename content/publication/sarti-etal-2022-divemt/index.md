abstract: We introduce DivEMT, the first publicly available post-editing study of
  Neural Machine Translation (NMT) over a typologically diverse set of target languages.
  Using a strictly controlled setup, 18 professional translators were instructed to
  translate or post-edit the same set of English documents into Arabic, Dutch, Italian,
  Turkish, Ukrainian, and Vietnamese. During the process, their edits, keystrokes,
  editing times and pauses were recorded, enabling an in-depth, cross-lingual evaluation
  of NMT quality and post-editing effectiveness. Using this new dataset, we assess
  the impact of two state-of-the-art NMT systems, Google Translate and the multilingual
  mBART-50 model, on translation productivity. We find that post-editing is consistently
  faster than translation from scratch. However, the magnitude of productivity gains
  varies widely across systems and languages, highlighting major disparities in post-editing
  effectiveness for languages at different degrees of typological relatedness to English,
  even when controlling for system architecture and training data size. We publicly
  release the complete dataset including all collected behavioral data, to foster
  new research on the translation capabilities of NMT systems for typologically diverse
  languages.
