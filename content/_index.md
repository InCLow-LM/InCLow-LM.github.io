        <font size="3"> Welcome to our homepage! **InCLow** stands for **In**terpretable, **C**ognitively inspired, **Low**-resource Language Models.

        We are a thriving research team led by [Arianna Bisazza](https://inclow-lm.github.io/author/arianna-bisazza/), working at the intersection of natural language processing and (cognitive) linguistics. Our [projects](https://inclow-lm.github.io/projects/) revolve around two key questions:

        - How to develop reliable language technologies that work well for a large variety of languages?
        
        - What can we learn about human language while attempting to do that?

        We’re proudly part of the larger Computational Linguistics group (<a href="https://www.rug.nl/research/clcg/research/cl">GroNLP</a>) at the University of Groningen, the Netherlands.

        Take a look at our [team members](https://inclow-lm.github.io/people/), [publications](https://inclow-lm.github.io/publication/), and [reading group](https://inclow-lm.github.io/reading-group/) agenda!

        **[Jan 2026]** The [GroNLP](https://www.rug.nl/research/clcg/research/cl) group of which we're part, is launching a brand new [Research Master in Natural Language Processing](https://www.rug.nl/masters/natural-language-processing-research/?lang=en) at the University of Groningen, starting Sept 2026. The program focuses on strong technical skills in language-based generative AI, and prepares you to contribute to cutting-edge research in academia or industry with a human-centred perspective. Come study with us and spread the [news](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/malvina-nissim-22094634a_natural-language-processing-activity-7407712688656695296-9Zfs?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAAAXz6W8B6G4UPQRAVDVRHhC2mkv0i6fZO24)!

        **[Dec 2025]** PhD student Yuchen Lian (Leiden University & Xi’an Jiaotong University) supervised by Arianna and Tessa Verhoef successfully defended her thesis "Emergence of Linguistic Universals in Neural Agents via Artificial Language Learning and Communication". Congratulations!!

        **[Dec 2025]** Gabriele successfully defended his thesis "From Insights to Impact: Actionable Interpretability for Neural Machine Translation", with a *cum laude* mention. Congratulations!!

        [Oct 2025] The [collaboration paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22888) led by [Jirui](https://betswish.github.io/) and [Shan](https://shanchen.dev/) (from Harvard University) is featured in the [State of AI Report 2025](https://www.stateof.ai/).
    
        [Aug 2025] EMNLP notifications came in. We're excited to share that InClow will bring 4 Main, 2 Findings and 2 TACL papers to Suzhou! Our paper topics in brief:
        unsupervised word-quality estimation for MT post-editing ([Gabriele](https://inclow-lm.github.io/author/gabriele-sarti)),
        controlling the thinking language in large reasoning models ([Jirui](https://inclow-lm.github.io/author/jirui-qi)),
        a neural-agent communication framework to study lexical change ([Yuqing](https://inclow-lm.github.io/author/yuqing-zhang)),
        training LMs on child-directed language ([Francesca](https://inclow-lm.github.io/author/francesca-padovani)),
        a Turkish benchmark of grammatical minimal pairs ([Ezgi](https://inclow-lm.github.io/author/ezgi-basar)) &
        a massively multilingual one, MultiBLiMP ([Jaap](https://inclow-lm.github.io/author/jaap-jumelet/)),
        the effect of stereotypes on LLM’s implicit personalization (Arianna, paper led by [Vera Neplenbroek](https://veranep.github.io)).
    
        [Jun 2025] Arianna gave a talk at the [COLT Symposium](https://www.upf.edu/web/colt/symposium), organized by Gemma Boleda and Marco Baroni at UPF, Barcelona. This was followed by a round-table on the convergence (or lack thereof) between findings coming from the fields of experimental and theoretical linguistics, neuroscience and the study of large language models.

        [May 2025] Arianna and Gabriele were interviewed by Groningen's Oog Radio station. The questions covered (of course) AI, but also the GroNLP group, what makes this research field so exciting (and a bit crazy nowadays!)... and a bit of music :) Recording available here: [HappyHourFM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PuOK5SYp4c).

        [May 2025] [Jaap](https://jumelet.ai/) gave a [talk in Edinburgh](https://informatics.ed.ac.uk/ilcc/news-events/seminars-2025/friday-2nd-may-at-11am-jaap-jumelet) on [MultiBLiMP: A Multilingual Benchmark of Linguistic Minimal Pairs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02768).
        
        [May 2025] Master student Anais Almendra from the University of Chile joined us for a 3-month visit. She works on morphological analysis of the endangered language Madupungun.

        [April 2025] [Gabriele](https://gsarti.com) presented his research on [word-level quality estimation for post-editing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03044) and [context](https://openreview.net/forum?id=XTHfNGI3zT) [attribution](https://aclanthology.org/2024.emnlp-main.347/) for language models at the [Multilinguality and Language Technology group of DFKI Saarland](https://www.dfki.de/en/web/research/research-departments/multilinguality-and-language-technology) and the [DEEL](https://www.irt-saintexupery.com/deel-le-programme-en-intelligence-artificielle-robuste-et-explicable-entre-dans-sa-phase-2/)/[FOR](https://www.irt-saintexupery.com/for-program/) teams at [IRT Saint-Éxupery](https://www.irt-saintexupery.com/).
        
        [April 2025] [Jirui](https://betswish.github.io/) gave two talks at [KPN](https://www.kpn.com/algemeen/english) and [University of Amsterdam](https://www.uva.nl/en) on three topics on Retrieval Augmented Generation ([MIRAGE](https://aclanthology.org/2024.emnlp-main.347/), [likelihood gauges answer accuracy](https://aclanthology.org/2025.naacl-long.78/), and [Consistency in Multilingual Context Utilization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00597))

##        [Mar 2025] [Arianna](https://www.cs.rug.nl/~bisazza/) gave a keynote talk at [NoDaLiDa/Baltic-HLT 2025](https://sites.google.com/view/nodalida-bhlt2025/keynote-speakers), titled "Not all Language Models need to be Large: Studying Language Evolution and Acquisition with Modern Neural Networks".
        
##        [Feb 2025] PhD student [Akari Haga](https://akari000.github.io/about/) from NAIST, Japan, joined us for a 6-month visit. She works on BabyLM-style models for Japanese.
