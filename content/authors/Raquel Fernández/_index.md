Raquel is a Full Professor of Computational Linguistics & Dialogue Systems at the University of Amsterdam and the Vice-Director for Research at the [Institute for Logic, Language & Computatio](https://www.illc.uva.nl/) (ILLC). She is a [Fellow](https://ellis.eu/fellows) of the [ELLIS Society](https://ellis.eu/) (the European Laboratory on Learning and Intelligent Systems) and a board member of the [ELLIS Amsterdam Unit](https://ivi.fnwi.uva.nl/ellis/).

She is interested in natural language processing (NLP) by humans and machines, regarding both language understanding and generation. In her research, she use computational tools including deep learning models to investigate how cognitive constraints, social interaction, and perception shape language use. To what extent is language grounded in visual information? What coordination strategies help us to communicate successfully with our dialogue partners? And how can answers to these kinds of question lead to better NLP systems? Her group carries out research on these and related topics from an interdisciplinary perspective, at the interface of computational linguistics, cognitive science, and artificial intelligence. Their publications can be found on the lab website, the [Dialogue Modelling Group](https://dmg-illc.github.io/dmg/), the [ACL anthology](https://aclanthology.org/people/r/raquel-fernandez/), and [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=XbosWYQAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate).

She has been fortunate to receive generous funding to support my work, including grants by the European Research Council (ERC Consolidator grant 819455) and the Dutch Research Council (VENI, VIDI, and Aspasia).
