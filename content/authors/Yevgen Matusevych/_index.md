Yevgen works at the [Computational Linguistics group](https://www.rug.nl/research/clcg/research/cl/?lang=en), which is a part of [Center for Language and Cognition](https://www.rug.nl/research/clcg/) at the University of Groningen, the Netherlands. He uses computational models to understand how humans learn their native and non-native languages, and how languages co-exist in the mind and in models. He is affiliated with the broader theme of Humane AI.

Earlier, he worked at the University of Edinburgh: at the [Centre for Language Evolution](http://www.lel.ed.ac.uk/cle/) with [Jennifer Culbertson](https://jennifer-culbertson.github.io/), investigating cognitive constraints that shape natural languages, and at the [Institute for Language, Cognition and Computation](http://web.inf.ed.ac.uk/ilcc), modeling phonetic learning and speech perception in native and non-native speakers, in collaboration with [Sharon Goldwater](https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/sgwater/), [Naomi Feldman](http://users.umiacs.umd.edu/~nhf/index.html), and [Thomas Schatz](http://thomas.schatz.cogserver.net/).

Even earlier, he worked with [Suzanne Stevenson](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~suzanne/) at the [Computational Linguistics group](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/compling/), University of Toronto, developing models of bilingual color cognition and free word association. And before that, he was a PhD student at [TiCC](http://www.tilburguniversity.edu/research/institutes-and-research-groups/ticc/), Tilburg University, supervised by [Afra Alishahi](https://ilk.uvt.nl/~aalishah/) and [Ad Backus](https://www.tilburguniversity.edu/webwijs/show/a.m.backus/). His thesis was about modeling the acquisition of verb argument structure by bilingual speakers.
