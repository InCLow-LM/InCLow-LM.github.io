Arianna is Associate Professor at the University of Groningen, where she has founded the InCLow Group.

Her research is funded by a NWO [Vidi grant](https://www.nwo.nl/en/news/97-leading-researchers-receive-vidi-grants) aimed at improving low-resource language modeling taking inspiration from child language acquisition insights. 
She is also part of two national-consortium projects, both funded by [NWA-ORC](https://initiatieven.wetenschapsagenda.nl/en) initiatives: Interpreting deep learning models for language, speech & music [(InDeep)](https://projects.illc.uva.nl/indeep/) and Low Resource Chat-based Conversational Intelligence [(LESSEN)](https://lessen-project.nl/). 
As part of a collaboration with Tessa Verhoef (Leiden University), she co-supervises two China Scholarship Council (CSC)-funded PhD students working on the simulation of human patterns of language learning and change. 

For more details, check her [homepage](https://www.cs.rug.nl/~bisazza/).

<!-- She is passionate about the statistical modeling of human languages, particularly in a multilingual context. Her long-term goal is to design robust language processing algorithms that can adapt to the large variety of linguistic phenomena observed around the world. -->
<!-- Among others, she work towards improving the quality of Machine Translation for challenging language pairs, and making state-of-the art NLP models more interpretable. -->
<!-- As a cross-disciplinary research enthusiast, she is interested in enhancing research on human language processing or language evolution with computational modeling tools. -->
<!-- Last but not least, she enjoys observing, interacting with, and finding daily inspiration in my two daughters and their trilingual minds in the making. -->
