Arianna is Associate Professor in the Computational Linguistics Group of the University of Groningen.

She is passionate about the statistical modeling of human languages, particularly in a multilingual context. Her long-term goal is to design robust language processing algorithms that can adapt to the large variety of linguistic phenomena observed around the world.
Among others, she work towards improving the quality of Machine Translation for challenging language pairs, and making state-of-the art NLP models more interpretable.
As a cross-disciplinary research enthusiast, she is interested in enhancing research on human language processing or language evolution with computational modeling tools.
Last but not least, she enjoys observing, interacting with, and finding daily inspiration in my two daughters and their trilingual minds in the making.
