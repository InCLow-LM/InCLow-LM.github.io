        [LESSEN Project](https://lessen-project.nl/):

        The LESSEN project aims to develop, implement, and test advanced chat-based conversational AI agents that are safe, transparent, and tailored for lesser-resourced tasks and domains. LESSEN concentrates on tasks, domains, and scenarios with fewer resources. By combining theoretical and experimental methodologies, LESSEN aims to tackle issues including computational efficiency, limited data availability, and privacy considerations. The project also aims to democratize conversational AI technology and promote its responsible use. Key research questions include:

        - How to build and adapt conversational agents efficiently?
        
        - How to generate engaging conversations across low-resource domains?
        
        - How to ensure safety, privacy, and transparency in conversational AI?
        
        Therefore LESSEN is organized along three research lines, each of which constitutes two work packages to address scientific challenges of the project which are (i)  the development of neural architectures that are compute and resource efficient; (ii) domain adaptation and data augmentation; and (iii) safety, privacy, and transparency. By tackling urgent research topics, LESSEN aims to democratize conversational AI technology for the Dutch language. With strong connections to academic and industrial partners, LESSEN achieves to have a significant scientific impact by establishing new benchmarks, developing innovative methods, and enhancing collaboration within the research community.

        [InDeep Project](https://projects.illc.uva.nl/indeep/):

        In the InDeep project pioneering researchers in the domain of interpretability of deep learning models of text, language, speech and music are brought together. They collaborate with companies and non-for-profit institutions working with language, speech and music technology, to develop applications that help assess the usefulness of alternative interpretability techniques on a range of different tasks. In “justification” tasks, we look at how interpretability techniques help give users meaningful feedback. Examples include legal and medical document text mining and audio search. In “augmentation” tasks we look at how these techniques facilitate the use of domain knowledge and models from outside deep learning to make the models perform even better. Examples include machine translation, music recommendation and writing feedback. In “interaction” tasks we allow users to influence the functioning of their automated systems, by providing both interpretable information on how the system operates, and letting human produced output find its way into the internal states of the learning algorithm. Examples include adapting speech recognition to non-standard accents and dialects, interactive music generation, and machine assisted translation.
